          <h2>London Spying! - My PRISM story</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Nov 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>In Germany there was some buzz around the PRISM program. Well yeah....some. Voices got risen but as with every news in Germany people went back to normal life when the media stopped reporting.
In the following I want to present a story that brought the topic back to my mind. I actually got right in a situation a few weeks ago I only heard the radio. This time it was me who got spied; by the government - probably, to be cautious.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this week I was one of a happy few that were able to attent this years O&#39;Reilly Strata conference in London. Actually I don&#39;t want to leave any words about the conference itself, but rather about the time I spend in London.</p>

<p>I knew there is a lot of public surveillance in the UK and I also knew the UK took a huge part of the buzz around the whole PRISM thing.</p>

<p>Before the actual conference took place I spend the weekend before in the London metropole to take some fresh Thamse breeze. As usual I booked a hotel on Booking.com in the center of London. When I arrived at the hotel I was surprised of the nice studio I booked - it was awesome. </p>

<p>As I am a Software Engineer I am addicted to my notebook and the internet. So I booked a 24 hour plan on hotel WiFi. I logged into the unsecured WiFi network and got prompted by the payment and login screen. So far, as usual. I entered my credit card data and submitted the order for the plan. Now, I find it actually quiet stupid that I entered all the credit card data within an unsecured network connection and even without an SSL-encrypted connection. But that wasn&#39;t all about the WiFi. </p>

<p>After I hit the checkout button I immediately received a web session from the hotel&#39;s WiFi system. I went for the stuff as usual and after some time I ended up trying to get into Facebook when my Google Chrome browser presented me a notice.</p>
